# &lt;auto-complete&gt; element

Auto-complete input values from server search results.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save @github/auto-complete-element
```

## Usage

### Script

Import as ES modules:

```js
import '@github/auto-complete-element'
```

With a script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="./node_modules/@github/auto-complete-element/dist/bundle.js">
```

### Markup

```html
<auto-complete src="/users/search" for="users-popup">
  <input type="text" name="users">
  <!--
    Optional clear button:
    - id must match the id of the input or the name of the input plus "-clear"
    - recommended to be *before* UL elements to avoid conflicting with their blur logic

    Please see Note below on this button for more details
  -->
  <button id="users-clear">X</button>
  <ul id="users-popup"></ul>
  <!--
    Optional div for screen reader feedback. Note the ID matches the ul, but with -feedback appended.
    Recommended: Use a "Screen Reader Only" class to position the element off the visual boundary of the page.
  -->
  <div id="users-popup-feedback" class="sr-only"></div>
</auto-complete>
```

If you want to enable auto-select (pressing Enter in the input will select the first option), using the above example:
```html
<auto-complete data-autoselect="true" src="/users/search" for="users-popup">
...
</auto-complete>
```

The server response should include the items that matched the search query.

```html
<li role="option">Hubot</li>
<li role="option">Bender</li>
<li role="option">BB-8</li>
<li role="option" aria-disabled="true">R2-D2 (powered down)</li>
```

The `data-autocomplete-value` attribute can be used to define the value for an
item whose display text needs to be different:

```html
<li role="option" data-autocomplete-value="bb8">BB-8 (astromech)</li>
```

### A Note on Clear button
While `input type="search"` comes with an `x` that clears the content of the field and refocuses it on many browsers, the implementation for this control is not keyboard accessible, and so we've opted to enable a customizable clear button so that your keyboard users will be able to interact with it.

As an example:
> In Chrome, this 'x' isn't a button but a div with a pseudo="-webkit-search-cancel-button". It doesn't have a tab index or a way to navigate to it without a mouse. Additionally, this control is only visible on mouse hover.


## Attributes

- `open` is true when the auto-complete result list is visible
- `value` is the selected value from the list or the empty string when cleared

## Events

### Network request lifecycle events

Request lifecycle events are dispatched on the `<auto-complete>` element. These events do not bubble.

- `loadstart` - The server fetch has started.
- `load` - The network request completed successfully.
- `error` - The network request failed.
- `loadend` - The network request has completed.

Network events are useful for displaying progress states while the request is in-flight.

```js
const completer = document.querySelector('auto-complete')
const container = completer.parentElement
completer.addEventListener('loadstart', () => container.classList.add('is-loading'))
completer.addEventListener('loadend', () => container.classList.remove('is-loading'))
completer.addEventListener('load', () => container.classList.add('is-success'))
completer.addEventListener('error', () => container.classList.add('is-error'))
```

### Auto-complete events

**`auto-complete-change`** is dispatched after a value is selected. In `event.detail` you can find:

- `relatedTarget`: The HTMLInputElement controlling the auto-complete result list.

```js
completer.addEventListener('auto-complete-change', function(event) {
  console.log('Auto-completed value chosen or cleared', completer.value)
  console.log('Related input element', event.relatedTarget)
})
```

## Browser support

Browsers without native [custom element support][support] require a [polyfill][].

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

## Development

```
npm install
npm test
```

To view changes locally, run `npm run examples`.

In `examples/index.html`, uncomment `<!--<script type="module" src="./dist/bundle.js"></script>-->` and comment out the script referencing the `unpkg` version. This allows you to use the `src` code in this repo. Otherwise, you will be pulling the latest published code, which will not reflect the local changes you are making.

## Accessibility Testing

We have included some custom rules that assist in providing guardrails to confirm this component is being used accessibly.

If you are using the `axe-core` library in your project,
```js
import axe from 'axe-core'
import autoCompleteRulesBuilder from '@github/auto-complete-element/validator'

const autoCompleteRules = autoCompleteRulesBuilder() // optionally, pass in your app's custom rules object, it will build and return the full object

axe.configure(autoCompleteRules)
axe.run(document)
```

## Validate usage in your project

To confirm your usage is working as designed,
```js
import {validate} from '@github/auto-complete-element/validator' 

validate(document)
```
Passes and failures may be determined by the length of the `passes` and `violations` arrays on the returned object:
```js
{
  passes: [],
  violations: []
}
```
